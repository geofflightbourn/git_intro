     <h3>What is Github?</h3>
     <p>Git is version control software originally designed by Linus Torvalds while developing Linux. A tool to help him and his fellow developers work on projects in non-linear workflows. Version Control lets multiple people work on a single project and manages changes without deleting or overwriting any part of the project. Github is an public, open-source tool that gives the gift of Git version control to all in an easy to use, visual, social website.

     <h3>Why use Guithub?</h3>
     <p>Here’s a situation; Say you and Bill are both working a website together, you make your changes, and Bill makes his. You upload your changes and everything is cool, until Bill also uploads his. Someones changes are going to be overwritten… This is where Git comes into play, it sees both of your changes, along with the originals and allows for the changes to put together without overwriting. If there is a conflict on a certain line of code, Git will tell you where, and allow you to choose between your’s or Bill’s changes. </p>
